   <h2 class="FAQ-Titles">DENTAL DENTURES FAQ’s</h2>
   
   
   <p class="Faq-Subtitles" id="FAQ1-Dental_dentures">How will dentures affect my appearance? </p>
   
   <p class="content" id="content-FAQ1-Dental-dentures">Replacing missing teeth is very good for your appearance as well as your health. A denture will help you look better by providing the support that your cheeks and lips need. Without this support, sagging facial muscles can make a person look older. At Oxford Dental Centre each set of dentures is personalised to your gums, lips, tongue and your whole mouth. Having good-looking teeth also gives you more confidence and freedom to smile.</p>
   
   <p class="Faq-Subtitles" id="FAQ2-Dental_dentures">Will dentures affect the way I eat?</p>
   <p class="content" id="content-FAQ2-Dental-dentures">Like anything new, you need time to adapt to your new denture. Chewing is one of the skills that needs to be adapted when you receive either replacement dentures or have your first dentures. Start with soft foods cut into small pieces. Chew slowly, using both sides of your mouth at the same time to stop the denture moving. Avoid sticky foods for a little while. After a while, you should be able to eat fairly normally, but it may take more time to get comfortable with harder foods or sticky foods. Properly fitted dentures enhance your chewing ability, helping your body properly digest foods and obtain the nutrition it needs.</p>
   
   
   <p class="Faq-Subtitles" id="FAQ3-Dental_dentures">Can I chew sugarless gum with dentures?</p>
   <p class="content" id="content-FAQ3-Dental-dentures">Dentures and chewing gum do not usually work well together, no matter which brand of chewing gum you decide to try. The gum typically sticks to the acrylic plastic in the denture and may break a seal on the dentures, which will loosen them as a result. Gum may remain stuck to the denture and eventually harden and discolour. Ultimately, if you wear dentures, you should avoid chewing gum.</p>
   
   <p class="Faq-Subtitles" id="FAQ4-Dental_dentures">How will dentures affect my speech?</p>
   <p class="content" id="content-FAQ4-Dental-dentures">The ability to speak clearly depends on coordination between your tongue, teeth, lips, and cheeks. A denture that's property titled allows all four components to work together naturally. With a new denture, you may initially notice some minor differences in speech - pronouncing certain words may take practice. Most patients find they adapt and speech becomes natural very quickly. Reading out loud and repeating difficult words will help. If you find that your dentures occasionally slip when you laugh, cough or smile, re-position them by gently biting down and swallowing. If this happens a lot, consult our dentist.</p>
   
   <p class="Faq-Subtitles" id="FAQ5-Dental_dentures">How do I take care of my dentures?</p>
   <p class="content" id="content-FAQ5-Dental-dentures">Avoid using boiling water to sterilize the denture, because hot water can cause the denture to lose its shape.<br>
If you wear a partial denture, remove it before brushing your natural teeth.<br>
When you're not wearing the denture, soak it in denture cleanser or water.<br>
Dentures may break if you drop them. Always clean your dentures over a bowl of water or a folded towel in case you drop them.<br>
If you notice a build-up of stains or scale, have your denture cleaned by our dental team.<br></p>

   <p class="Faq-Subtitles" id="FAQ6-Dental_dentures">How do I clean my dentures?</p>
   <p class="content" id="content-FAQ6-Dental-dentures">Daily care and cleaning of a new denture is very important to help maintain good dental health. For everyday cleaning, take the dentures out and hold with your thumb and forefinger. Make sure wherever you're cleaning them, it's never over a hard surface. Put a towel down on the vanity, or make sure the sink is full of water. If you drop them, they won't break. Brush thoroughly, as you would if the teeth were in your mouth. Avoid using bleaching agents, as they will discolour the pink acrylic for the gum line.</p>
   
   <p class="Faq-Subtitles" id="FAQ7-Dental_dentures">How long will dentures last?</p>
   <p class="content" id="content-FAQ7-Dental-dentures">Dentures typically last anywhere from 5-10 years. The bone and tissue in your mouth change as you age - even though your teeth are gone, your mouth and gums will continue to change shape for the rest of your life. Because dentures are artificial, obviously, they will not change with the shape of your mouth and will need to be replaced or adjusted.<br><br>
A loose denture can cause discomfort and problems of sores or infections in your mouth. It can also make eating and talking more difficult. It is important to replace loose dentures before they cause problems.</p>
    
   
   <p class="Faq-Subtitles" id="FAQ8-Dental_dentures">How often should I visit the dentist after I have dentures?</p>
   <p class="content" id="content-FAQ8-Dental-dentures">It is important to continue having regular dental check-ups so that our dentist can examine any oral issues. With age, your mouth will continue to change as the bone under your denture shrinks or recedes. The dentist will be able to evaluate the fit of your denture, offer suggestions for denture care and hygiene, and check for issues that may arise.</p>
   
   
   <p class="Faq-Subtitles" id="FAQ9-Dental_dentures">Are there any alternatives to dentures?</p>
   <p class="content" id="content-FAQ9-Dental-dentures">Bridges and Dental Implants are a possible alternative to dentures. Implants are artificial tooth roots that are surgically anchored into your jaw to hold a replacement tooth or bridge in place. Implants and bridges may resemble the "feel" of real teeth.</p>
   
   <p class="Faq-Subtitles" id="FAQ10-Dental_dentures">How can I whiten my dentures?</p>
   <p class="content" id="content-FAQ10-Dental-dentures">It is not possible to whiten dentures like natural teeth because dentures are made of plastic. To minimise staining, properly clean your dentures daily to remove food and plaque bacteria. Brushing with a denture brush or soft toothbrush will prevent dentures from becoming permanently stained and keep your mouth healthy.</p>
   
   <p class="Faq-Subtitles" id="FAQ11-Dental_dentures">Can I sleep wearing my dentures?</p>
   <p class="content" id="content-FAQ11-Dental-dentures">Yes, you can wear your dentures at night, but it is recommended that you remove them before you go to sleep. This will give your gums and bone a chance to relax from the pressure of the denture during the day. Dentures should be cleaned at night and stored in water during the night.</p>
   
   <p class="Faq-Subtitles" id="FAQ12-Dental_dentures">When can I wear my dentures?</p>
   <p class="content" id="content-FAQ12-Dental-dentures">This is a personal preference; however, we recommend that you wear your dentures as much as possible. Remove them at least once a day and brush the tissues underlying the dentures with a soft toothbrush. This removes any plaque build-up along with any food debris. Removing dentures for some time or during the night stimulates the blood vessels which is an essential part of healthy tissue.</p>
   
   <p class="Faq-Subtitles" id="FAQ13-Dental_dentures">How should I store my dentures?</p>
   <p class="content" id="content-FAQ13-Dental-dentures">Dentures are designed to function in a moist environment it is therefore it is not advised to let the dry out. If your dentures are left out of your mouth for any long period of time they should be kept in water.</p>
   
   <p class="Faq-Subtitles" id="FAQ14-Dental_dentures">Will my dentures break easily?</p>
   <p class="content" id="content-FAQ14-Dental-dentures">Dentures are made from very resilient materials, but it is recommended to clean them over a basin of water or a towel so that if they fall they do not break.</p>
