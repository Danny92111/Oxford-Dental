	 <p class="content hide" id="content-FAQ2-Nervous-patients">Conscious IV sedation is a fantastic way to alleviate patient anxiety and distress associated with dental procedures. In sedation we administer a drug that will prevent you from being conscious of the procedures being carried out. You will not remember anything about the treatment, and it will seem to pass very quickly. Under conscious sedation, a patient will be in a very calm and relaxed state – but will still be conscious throughout the duration of the procedure; this enables the dentist at Oxford Dental Centre to communicate easily with the patient, who in turn can readily follow the requests or instructions of the dentist.<br><br>At Oxford Dental Centre, we have routinely used IV sedation to treat patients apprehensive of dental treatment to make them Smile Proud!<br><br>IV sedation, can be applied for almost all types of dental treatments ranging from routine hygiene to extensive complex dental treatment, please ask our dentist. Additionally, IV sedation also can offer varying degrees of retrograde amnesia. This prevents recollection of the dental treatment which for some patients enables them to visit the dentist for routine check-up without being nervous. This contrasts with general anaesthesia, where patients may prefer to be “put to sleep” or “want to be unaware of the dental treatment”.</p>

    <p class="Faq-Subtitles Faq-title-with-border" id="FAQ4-Nervous-patients">Oral Conscious Sedation </p><br><br>
	 
	 <p class="content hide" id="content-FAQ4-Nervous-patients">Oral sedatives are taken by mouth in the form of tablets, capsules or liquids. These drugs can either be used to relax you before your trip to the dentist or act as a sedative to help you when you are having treatment. It acts in about 20 minutes.</p>

	 <div class="Faq-title-content-container">
	 <p class="Faq-Subtitles Faq-title-with-border" id="FAQ5-Nervous-patients">I had a bad experience as a child what is it like now? </p><br><br>
	  
	 <p class="content hide" id="content-FAQ5-Nervous-patients">Dental techniques have improved so much over the last few years that modern dental treatment can now be completely painless. If you have not been to see a dentist for some time, you will probably find that things have improved a lot since your last visit. The general attitude is likely to be more relaxed; the dental techniques and safety procedures will be much better and the equipment more up to date.</p>
	 </div>
	 <div class="Faq-title-content-container">
	 <p class="Faq-Subtitles Faq-title-with-border" id="FAQ6-Nervous-patients">Will the dental treatment hurt? </p><br><br>
	  
	 <p class="content hide" id="content-FAQ6-Nervous-patients">Patients are often frightened that on their visit to the dentist they will have to sit through uncomfortable or downright painful treatment, especially if they have suffered from bad experiences at the dentist in the past. We promise this will not happen when you visit us. We use excellent anaesthetics and gentle techniques and we consider our care of you to be failing unless you are always completely comfortable . The most frequent comment people make at the end of their treatment is ″if I had known it was that painless I wouldn′t have worried about coming″.</p>
	 </div>
	 <div class="Faq-title-content-container">
	 <p class="Faq-Subtitles Faq-title-with-border" id="FAQ7-Nervous-patients">I feel uneasy when I am not in control </p><br><br>
	  
	 <p class="content hide" id="content-FAQ7-Nervous-patients">We will never start treatment, even a check-up, without your being ready. We will agree a signal you can give us, such as a raised hand, if you need us to stop what we are doing at any time. If you decide part way through an appointment that you have had enough for today, we will stop treatment. You can have absolute faith that you are in complete control of what is always happening.</p>
	 </div>
	 <div class="Faq-title-content-container">
	 <p class="Faq-Subtitles Faq-title-with-border" id="FAQ8-Nervous-patients">I am uneasy with dental needles </p><br><br>
	  
	 <p class="content hide" id="content-FAQ8-Nervous-patients">Lots of people have the same phobia, so you are not alone. We always try to use materials and techniques that do not need an injection if you are frightened of needles. If we feel that it is advisable that your teeth are numb before treatment, we will explain this to you. We can use a special gel to numb your gum first if you would like, and then our local anaesthetic injections are given so gently that many people do not even feel them.</p>

	 <div class="Faq-title-content-container">
	 <p class="Faq-Subtitles Faq-title-with-border" id="FAQ9-Nervous-patients">The dentist′s drill makes me anxious </p><br><br>
	  
	 <p class="content hide" id="content-FAQ9-Nervous-patients">Again, this is a common worry.<br><br>If your anxiety is based on a worry that the drilling will hurt, we would refer you back to our pain free promise. You will not have to sit through any painful treatment here. If you don′t like the noise, you are welcome to bring your iPod or MP3 player. If you dislike the sensation of drilling, we can do shorter treatments, or give you frequent ″breathers″.</p>

	 <div class="Faq-title-content-container">
	  <p class="Faq-Subtitles Faq-title-with-border" id="FAQ10-Nervous-patients">I am embarrassed about how bad my teeth are </p><br><br>
	  
	 <p class="content hide" id="content-FAQ10-Nervous-patients">The team at Oxford Dental Centre are all experienced dental professionals, and we can promise you that we see patients with high treatment requirements all the time.

   <div class="Faq-title-content-container">
    <p class="Faq-Subtitles Faq-title-with-border" id="FAQ11-Nervous-patients">Do you offer sedation at Oxford Dental Centre? </p><br><br>
	  
	 <p class="content hide" id="content-FAQ11-Nervous-patients">Yes, we do, sedation is a fantastic way to relax during your treatment, the medication puts you into a calm dream-like state. Most patients come around after sedation not even realising that they have had extensive oral surgery. We offer both oral sedation and intravenous sedation which is given by injection. Whichever technique is used, the procedures involved will be FULLY EXPLAINED.</p>

   <div class="Faq-title-content-container">
    <p class="Faq-Subtitles Faq-title-with-border" id="FAQ12-Nervous-patients">Will I ever feel differently about visiting the dentist?</p><br><br>
	  
	 <p class="content hide" id="content-FAQ12-Nervous-patients">It is highly likely! As you get to know and trust the dentist, hygienist and other members of the dental team at our practice, your fears will dampen.</p>
